What now is the musical challenge of the future?
I believe it is the limits in our understanding of the human brain;
and specifically knowing what sound waves, sound patterns,
timbres and sequences that humans recognize as beautiful and meaningful music â€“ and why!
--- Max Mathews, from the Introduction to the Audio Programming Book
